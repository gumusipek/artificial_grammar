Welcome to the Experiment


This experiment consists of two parts. You are now about to begin the first part.

In this phase, you will see a series of pseudo (non-sense) words on the screen. 

Your task is to rewrite the words exactly as you see them and press ENTER when you are done with typing. If you would like to delete a letter you wrote, you can use BACKSPACE key.

You will receive feedback, if your response is incorrect, and you will need to retype the word until you get it right.

When you are ready to start, press the SPACE BAR to continue.
